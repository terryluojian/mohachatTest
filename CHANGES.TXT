There were couple of complains that the weather plug-in doesn't function. The
cause was CURL PHP extension. HTTP_Request PEAR package was a good replacement which will
function in any PHP installation with access to outside world. So now dependancy
on CURL for the PHP proxy is no more.

Version 0.1b7 - 2007/02/06
---

As suggested by Travis [rennemannt _at_ users _dot_ sourceforge _dot_ net]
password security model was moved out of the Users Class. Use $pwAlgo variable
in the config/configuration.php to change the password hashing algorithm.
Hope extensibility improved with this introduction.

Plug-in architecture was further improved with the new requirements that came
with the introduction of the Weather plug-in widget. Plug-ins can now make
connections to the external world through a PHP proxy. Further this PHP proxy
comes with caching to improve performance.

	* Password security model was introduced, and it is not part of the Users
	  class.
