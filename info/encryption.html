<p>Your chat messages are encrypted before being transmitted from the server and vice-versa. Further the messages are never stored unencrypted.</p>
<p>MOHA Chat uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTEA" target="_blank">eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm</a> to encrypt your messages using a 128bit key. The key is unique to each client. So there is no way* that anyone could obtain the key and evesdrop.</p>
